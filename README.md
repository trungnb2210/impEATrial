# impEATrial
Fullstack application for ICHACK23

Awarded Second Place Interdisciplintary Challenge - IC HACK 2023

impEATrial is a fullstack application written in React Native with an SQL backend, which utilises NLP modules, GPT-3, and the Terra API. We developed this application for ICHack 2023.

impEATrial provides personalised meal recommendations based on the user's dietary restrictions, taste preferences, and nutritional needs, along with a centralised database of all menu items across various restaurants available on the Imperial campus. The app also acts as a social platform by connecting users with similar food preferences and suggesting restaurants of common interest.

IC Hack 2023 is the biggest university hackathon in the UK, boasting over 600 international competitors who are all university students or recent graduates.
